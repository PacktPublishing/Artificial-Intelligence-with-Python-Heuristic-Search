## About the Video Course
This course is a go-to guide for the topics of logic programming, heuristic search, genetic algorithms, and building games with AI. It will help you learn to program with AI. We start with basic puzzles, parsing trees, and expression matching. Then weâ€™ll build solutions for region coloring and maze solving. The course also has fun-filled videos on building bots to play Tic-tac-toe, Connect Four, and Hexapawn.
